# Schedule of Information Science (INST) Classes

## Description
This is a program intended to visually represent information about the Information Science classes at the University of Maryland thus far. While there is a Schedule of Classes program that is similar on Testudo, the built-in platform, This Schedule of Information Science (INST) Classes will extend its goal and describe various characteristics students are generally interested in. As of November 25, 2020, these features include sorting and searching by: the course number, course name, average semester grade, pass rate, professor, professor rating, and format of learning. Furthermore, users will be able to save classes that fulfill their wanted criteria, and the program will print them out at the end.
